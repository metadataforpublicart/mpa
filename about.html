                        <p id="about">Metadata for Public Art (MPA) was created by University of Michigan MSI students Emma Heck and Joel Liesenberg for their MSI Mastery Course project. The project grew out of the need for metadata that more accurately describes public art projects. The idea started with public artist Jack Becker, founder of the Institute for Public Art (IPA). The IPA focuses on public art as a place-maker and generator of social capital, world-wide. It does this through researching case studies, sharing information, and promoting exemplary projects. Each year, the IPA, in partnership with Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts (SAFA), bestows the International Award for Public Art (IAPA) to exemplary case studies from around the world.<br><br>Additional information regarding guidelines for use (including metadata crosswalks and controlled vocabularies) will be added to this site upon completion of the project.</p>

                        <p id="thanks">We would like to give special thanks to our client partners, Jack Becker and Maryrose Flanigan, for their hard work, trust, and assistance throughout this project.
